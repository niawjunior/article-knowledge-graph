# Translation Issue Fix

## Problem

The AI was translating entity names to Spanish even though the original article was in English:

### What Was Happening
```
Input (English):
"Bambi is 21 years old"
"Khon Kaen"
"31 years old"

Output (Spanish):
"21 a√±os" ‚ùå
"Ciudad donde Bambi estudia" ‚ùå
"31 a√±os" ‚ùå
```

## Root Cause

The system prompt said:
```
"Do NOT translate to English"
```

This confused the AI into thinking:
- ‚ùå "Don't translate TO English" = "Translate to another language"
- ‚ùå AI chose Spanish randomly
- ‚ùå Ignored the actual article language

## Solution

Changed the prompt to be clearer:

### Before
```typescript
IMPORTANT: Keep all entity names, descriptions, and relationships 
in the SAME LANGUAGE as the original article. 
Do NOT translate to English.
```

### After
```typescript
IMPORTANT: Keep all entity names and descriptions 
in the SAME LANGUAGE as the original article. 
Do NOT translate anything.
```

## Key Changes

1. **Removed "to English"** - Was confusing
2. **Changed to "anything"** - More clear
3. **Simplified wording** - Less ambiguous

## Expected Behavior After Fix

```
Input (English):
"Bambi is 21 years old"
"Khon Kaen"
"31 years old"

Output (English):
"21 years old" ‚úÖ
"Khon Kaen" ‚úÖ
"31 years old" ‚úÖ
```

```
Input (Thai):
"‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ö‡∏µ ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏∏ 21 ‡∏õ‡∏µ"
"‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô"

Output (Thai):

"‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ô" ‚úÖ
```

```

## Why This Happened

### AI Interpretation Issue
The phrase "Do NOT translate to English" can be interpreted as:
1. ‚úÖ "Don't translate (keep original language)"
2. ‚ùå "Don't translate TO English (translate to something else)"

The AI chose interpretation #2, which caused it to translate to Spanish.

### Better Phrasing
"Do NOT translate anything" is unambiguous:
- ‚úÖ Clear instruction
- ‚úÖ No room for misinterpretation
- ‚úÖ Works for all languages

## Files Updated

1. ‚úÖ **General article** - Updated prompt
2. ‚úÖ **Investment article** - Updated prompt
3. ‚úÖ **Revenue analysis** - Updated prompt

All three article types now have the corrected prompt.

## Migration

### For Existing Articles
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Regenerate articles** to get correct language
- Old articles may have Spanish translations
- New extractions will use original language

### For New Articles
- ‚úÖ Will automatically use correct language
- ‚úÖ No translation issues
- ‚úÖ Maintains original language

## Summary

### What Changed
- ‚úÖ Removed confusing "to English" phrase
- ‚úÖ Changed to clear "anything" instruction
- ‚úÖ Applied to all 3 article types

### Result
Entity names now stay in the **original article language**:
- English article ‚Üí English entities
- Thai article ‚Üí Thai entities
- Spanish article ‚Üí Spanish entities
- No unwanted translations! üåç

### Next Steps
1. Regenerate your test article
2. Verify entities are in English
3. Should see "21 years old" not "21 a√±os"
