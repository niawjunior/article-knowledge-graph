# Graph Visualization Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. **Better Layout Algorithm**
- Changed from simple circular layout to **hierarchical radial layout**
- Article node (root) is placed at the top center
- Entity nodes are arranged in a circle around the center
- More balanced distribution of nodes

### 2. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**
- **Article node** is now larger (250-350px wide) with thicker border (4px)
- **Entity nodes** remain standard size (150-200px wide)
- Larger text and icons for the root article node
- Clear visual distinction between root and child nodes

### 3. **Improved Edge Styling**
- Edges from article to entities are **thicker (3px)** and **animated**
- Edges from article use **blue color** (#3b82f6)
- Entity-to-entity edges are **thinner (2px)** and **gray** (#94a3b8)
- Edge labels are cleaner with better formatting
- Changed from `smoothstep` to `default` edge type for cleaner routing

### 4. **Better Spacing**
- Increased radius from 300px to 350px
- Better node distribution to reduce overlap
- Nodes positioned starting from top (-Ï€/2) for better visual balance

### 5. **Enhanced Interactivity**
- Hover effects on nodes
- Tooltips show descriptions
- Click nodes to see details in console (ready for expansion)
- Smooth transitions and animations

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Force-Directed Layout**: Use D3-force or dagre for automatic optimal positioning
2. **Node Expansion**: Click to expand/collapse related nodes
3. **Filtering**: Filter by entity type
4. **Search**: Search and highlight specific nodes
5. **Export**: Export graph as image or PDF
6. **Clustering**: Group related entities visually
7. **Timeline View**: Show temporal relationships for Date nodes
8. **Details Panel**: Side panel showing full node information on click

## How to Use

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Paste any article text
4. Click "Generate Knowledge Graph"
5. Explore the interactive mind map
6. Use mouse wheel to zoom, drag to pan
7. Click nodes to interact (more features coming)
