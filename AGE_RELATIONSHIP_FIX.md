# Age Relationship Fix

## Problem

Age information was being extracted as separate DATE entities ("31 years old", "24 years old") but **not connected** to the people, resulting in disconnected nodes in the graph.

### What Was Happening

```
❌ Current Behavior:
Person: "Niaw" (disconnected)
Date: "31 years old" (disconnected)
Person: "Bambi" (disconnected)
Date: "24 years old" (disconnected)

No relationships connecting age to people!
```

### Root Cause

The system prompt didn't include age-related relationships, so the AI had no guidance on how to connect age information to people.

## Solution

Added comprehensive relationship types for personal information, including age.

### Updated Relationship Types

```typescript
2. **Relationships** with semantic meaning:
   - For people: 
     * "has-age" ← NEW!
     * "lives-in"
     * "born-in"
     * "works-at"
     * "studies-at"
     * "knows"
     * "related-to"
     * "married-to"
     * "child-of"
     * "parent-of"
   
   - For organizations: "works-at", "leads", "member-of", ...
   - For business/tech: "attacked-by", "victim-of", ...
   - For events: "occurred-on", "happened-at", "involves"
   
   IMPORTANT: For age information, create "has-age" relationship 
   from Person to Date entity
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

```
✅ New Behavior:
Person: "Niaw" ──has-age──> Date: "31 years old"
Person: "Bambi" ──has-age──> Date: "24 years old"

Ages are now connected to people!
```

## Example Graph Structure

### Before (Disconnected)
```json
{
  "entities": [
    { "id": "niaw", "name": "Niaw", "type": "Person" },
    { "id": "age-31", "name": "31 years old", "type": "Date" },
    { "id": "bambi", "name": "Bambi", "type": "Person" },
    { "id": "age-24", "name": "24 years old", "type": "Date" }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    // ❌ No age relationships!
  ]
}
```

### After (Connected)
```json
{
  "entities": [
    { "id": "niaw", "name": "Niaw", "type": "Person" },
    { "id": "age-31", "name": "31 years old", "type": "Date" },
    { "id": "bambi", "name": "Bambi", "type": "Person" },
    { "id": "age-24", "name": "24 years old", "type": "Date" }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    { "from": "niaw", "to": "age-31", "type": "has-age" },  // ✅ Connected!
    { "from": "bambi", "to": "age-24", "type": "has-age" }  // ✅ Connected!
  ]
}
```

## Additional Relationship Types Added

### For People
- `has-age` - Person → Date (age information)
- `lives-in` - Person → Location (residence)
- `born-in` - Person → Location (birthplace)
- `studies-at` - Person → Organization (education)
- `knows` - Person → Person (acquaintance)
- `married-to` - Person → Person (spouse)
- `child-of` - Person → Person (parent-child)
- `parent-of` - Person → Person (parent-child)

### For Organizations
- `located-in` - Organization → Location (headquarters/office)

### For Events
- `occurred-on` - Event → Date (when it happened)
- `happened-at` - Event → Location (where it happened)
- `involves` - Event → Person/Organization (participants)

## Testing

### Test Case: Age Information
```
Input Article:
"Niaw is 31 years old and works in Bangkok. 
Bambi is 24 years old and studies at Khon Kaen."

Expected Extraction:
Entities:
- Person: Niaw
- Date: 31 years old
- Location: Bangkok
- Person: Bambi
- Date: 24 years old
- Location: Khon Kaen

Relationships:
- Niaw → has-age → 31 years old ✅
- Niaw → works-at → Bangkok
- Bambi → has-age → 24 years old ✅
- Bambi → studies-at → Khon Kaen
```

### Test Case: Personal Information
```
Input Article:
"John, 45, lives in New York and is married to Sarah, 42."

Expected Extraction:
Entities:
- Person: John
- Date: 45
- Location: New York
- Person: Sarah
- Date: 42

Relationships:
- John → has-age → 45 ✅
- John → lives-in → New York ✅
- John → married-to → Sarah ✅
- Sarah → has-age → 42 ✅
```

## Benefits

### 🔗 **Connected Graph**
- Age information now properly linked to people
- No more disconnected date nodes
- Complete relationship network

### 📊 **Better Insights**
- Can query "Show me people and their ages"
- Can filter by age range
- Can analyze age demographics

### 🎯 **Richer Context**

### 🔍 **Improved Queries**
```typescript
// Find person's age
const age = relationships
  .filter(r => r.from === "niaw" && r.type === "has-age")
  .map(r => entities.find(e => e.id === r.to));

// Find people in a location
const peopleInBangkok = relationships
  .filter(r => r.type === "lives-in" && r.to === "bangkok-id")
  .map(r => entities.find(e => e.id === r.from));
```

## Migration

### For Existing Articles
1. **Regenerate articles** with personal information
2. Age relationships will now be created automatically
3. Graph will show proper connections

### For New Articles
- ✅ Age relationships work automatically
- ✅ Personal information properly connected
- ✅ Richer relationship network

## Summary

### What Changed
- ✅ Added "has-age" relationship type
- ✅ Added personal relationship types (lives-in, born-in, etc.)
- ✅ Added organization location relationships
- ✅ Added event relationships
- ✅ Updated system prompt with examples

### Result
Age and other personal information now properly connected in the knowledge graph! 🎉

### Next Steps
