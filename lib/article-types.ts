Analyze the following article and extract a knowledge graph with rich context.

IMPORTANT: Keep all entity names and descriptions in the SAME LANGUAGE as the original article. Do NOT translate anything.

Extract:
1. **Entities** - Use ONLY these entity types (enforced by schema):
   - **Person**: Individuals mentioned by name (executives, team members, employees)
   - **Organization**: Companies, institutions, departments, divisions, teams, labs
   - **Location**: Countries, cities, regions, offices
   - **Technology**: Software, systems, platforms
   - **Event**: Breaches, announcements, incidents
   - **Concept**: Roles, positions, business functions, services
   - **Date**: When events occurred
   
   CRITICAL: Use ONLY the exact entity type names listed above. The schema will reject other types.

2. **Relationships** with semantic meaning:
   - For people: "has-age", "lives-in", "born-in", "works-at", "studies-at", "knows", "related-to", "married-to", "child-of", "parent-of"
   - For organizations: "works-at", "leads", "member-of", "reports-to", "manages", "part-of", "located-in"
   - For business/tech: "attacked-by", "victim-of", "owns", "uses", "affected-by", "leaked-from", "reported-by", "contains", "targets", "supplies-to", "competes-with", "partners-with"
   - For events: "occurred-on", "happened-at", "involves"
   - Avoid generic "mentions" or "related-to" unless no specific relationship exists
   - Include relationship strength (strong/medium/weak)

3. **Metadata**:
   - Entity sentiment: positive (good news), negative (victim/problem), neutral
   - Entity importance: high (key players), medium (supporting), low (minor mentions)

Rules:
- Extract ALL entities mentioned in the article, even if the content is short
- For short articles, extract at minimum: all people, all objects/things, all locations, all actions
- **IMPORTANT: Each unique entity should appear ONLY ONCE** - Do not create duplicate entities
- If the same person, location, or concept is mentioned multiple times, use the SAME entity ID
- For example: If "Bangkok" is mentioned 3 times, create ONE entity with id "bangkok", not three separate entities
- For ages: Create ONE entity per age value (e.g., "31 years old" should be one entity, not multiple)
- **CRITICAL for Thai names**: 
  * "พี่แนน" (Pee Nan) and "แนน" (Nan) are the SAME person - use ONE entity
  * Thai honorifics like "พี่" (Pee), "คุณ" (Khun) are just titles - the core name is the same
  * Example: "พี่จูน" and "จูน" → ONE entity named "จูน"
  * When listing multiple people like "แนน เนี้ยว และ เก้า", these are THREE separate people: "แนน", "เนี้ยว", "เก้า"
- Create meaningful relationships showing connections between entities
- Use specific, actionable relationship types
- Mark victims/attackers with appropriate sentiment
- Prioritize entities by their importance to the story
- Even simple sentences should extract multiple entities (e.g., "Wife has a cat named COCO" → extract: wife (Person), cat (Concept), COCO (Person/name))`,
