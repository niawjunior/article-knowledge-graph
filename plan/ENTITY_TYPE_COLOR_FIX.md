# Entity Type Color Fix - General Articles

## Problem
General article nodes were showing as **gray** instead of having colors because:
1. AI was extracting entity types as **"PEOPLE"** and **"LOCATIONS"** (plural, uppercase)
2. Color config only had **"Person"** and **"Location"** (singular, lowercase)
3. No fallback for plural/uppercase variations

## Solution

### 1. Added All Entity Type Variations to Color Config
Updated `/lib/visualization-config.ts` to support all variations:

```typescript
// Person variations
Person: "#10b981",      // green
PERSON: "#10b981",
People: "#10b981",
PEOPLE: "#10b981",

// Location variations  
Location: "#f59e0b",    // amber
LOCATION: "#f59e0b",
Locations: "#f59e0b",
LOCATIONS: "#f59e0b",

// Organization variations
Organization: "#8b5cf6", // purple
ORGANIZATION: "#8b5cf6",
Organizations: "#8b5cf6",
ORGANIZATIONS: "#8b5cf6",

// And similar for: Event, Concept, Date, Technology
```

### 2. Updated AI Prompt for Consistency
Updated `/lib/article-types.ts` to explicitly instruct AI to use singular forms:

```
CRITICAL: Always use SINGULAR entity type names 
(Person, not People; Location, not Locations)
```

## Color Mapping - General Articles

| Entity Type | Color | Hex |
|------------|-------|-----|
| **Person/People** | üü¢ Green | #10b981 |
| **Organization** | üü£ Purple | #8b5cf6 |
| **Location** | üü† Amber | #f59e0b |
| **Event** | üî¥ Red | #ef4444 |
| **Concept** | ü©∑ Pink | #ec4899 |
| **Date** | üîµ Indigo | #6366f1 |
| **Technology** | üî∑ Cyan | #06b6d4 |
| **Article** | üîµ Blue | #3b82f6 |

## Supported Variations

Each entity type now supports **4 variations**:
- Singular lowercase: `Person`, `Location`, `Organization`
- Singular uppercase: `PERSON`, `LOCATION`, `ORGANIZATION`
- Plural lowercase: `People`, `Locations`, `Organizations`
- Plural uppercase: `PEOPLE`, `LOCATIONS`, `ORGANIZATIONS`

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. **Delete the existing article** from your database (to force re-extraction)
2. **Paste the article again** with "General Article" type
3. **Generate the graph** - colors should now appear
4. **Verify** that PEOPLE nodes are green, LOCATIONS are amber, etc.

## Why This Happened

The OpenAI API sometimes returns entity types in different formats:
- ‚úÖ Expected: `Person`, `Location` (singular)
- ‚ùå Got: `PEOPLE`, `LOCATIONS` (plural, uppercase)

This is common when the AI interprets the prompt differently or when using different models/temperatures.

## Files Modified
- `/lib/visualization-config.ts` - Added all entity type variations
- `/lib/article-types.ts` - Made prompt more explicit about singular forms

## Future Prevention

The color config now has comprehensive fallbacks, so even if the AI returns unexpected variations, colors will still work. The prompt also explicitly instructs the AI to use singular forms for consistency.
